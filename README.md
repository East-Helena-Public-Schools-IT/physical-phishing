# Usage


To generate locations for you to use later:
```sh
phisher --generate "Some Location"
```

To run the server:
```sh
phisher --serve
```

Then, save the generated pairs to a file for later use. Put the ids (uuid) as a link `whatever.ip:port/<uuid>` then you can decide how to get users to (hopefully not) run a script which pings that url.
